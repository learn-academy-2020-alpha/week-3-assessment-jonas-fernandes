# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: It is turning a value inside an object into a variable

  Researched answer: It allows you to take an object and unpack their values into individual variables. 
  This is probably the most immediately useful type of destructuring. When destructuring an object you are 
  essentially taking the properties of an object and breaking them out into individual, recallable variables.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: Value, index, array

  Researched answer:. map() have three built-in arguments - the value, index, and array.What the arguments are 
  named is arbitrary, but the order will always be the same. The higher-order functions have to take at least one 
  argument (value) but can take two or three if needed.



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object contains a key and a value; whereas classes are more like functions.  

  Researched answer: Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. 
  Just like functions, classes have their own scope. Objects are variables that contain a collection of key:value pairs.
  Objects are the cross section of data and behavior (methods)



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: An HTML div functions like a container; whereas span defines the scope of an element.

  Researched answer: An HTML div is a block-level element. It always starts on a new line and takes up the full 
  width available. A span is an inline element. It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width 
  as necessary. The <span> element is often used as a container for some text.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: I forget. 
  
  Researched answer: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. 
  Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They let us render an 
  array of elements / components in a JSX-y way, which can solve a lot of layout and styling issues with tables, lists, and CSS grids.

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Media queries is one.

  Researched answer: 1) Fluid grids. The different elements on a webpage are laid out on a grid and sized based on 
  relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units, like number of pixels.
  2) Flexible images. Images are also sized relatively, to keep them from “barging in” on other parts of
  the grid on a different screen size.
  3) Media queries. This is just a fancy way of saying that your site can detect the device that it’s
  being displayed on, and automatically adjust its size and layout accordingly.
